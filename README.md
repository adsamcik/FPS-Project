FPS-Project
===========
FPS-Project is work name for First-person game that is aimed primarily on addons. This means that on initial release, the core will be as small as possible and built-in plugins should be easily toggleable. This can create interesting experience where you can experiment, modify, create unique maps etc. The most notable down-side is currently the thing that addons must be compiled to whole project, they can't be added seperately (not in roadmap to change this yet, sorry). This can change in future. Feel free to use this code anywhere you want, but please mention where did you get it, others might find it useful too.
